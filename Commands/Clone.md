# git clone

Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history

It will also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can use the `git pull` command to pull updates from the original repository. 

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:
```
git clone https://github.co/ElevenFiftyAcademy/TerminalDragon.git
```
